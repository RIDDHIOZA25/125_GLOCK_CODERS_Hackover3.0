Hindu mythology is the body of myths and literature attributed to, and espoused by, the adherents of the Hindu religion, found in Hindu texts such as the Vedic literature, epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana, the Puranas, and regional literature like the Tamil Periya Puranam and Naalayira Divya Prabandham, and the Mangal Kavya of Bengal. These Indian mythologies had the most tragic and intellectual events and so were their minds. What if we all get a chance to face such situations and see how our brains find a way through these circumstances and react. This can be witnessed in the form of a game.

In order to present the affirmative side of Indian mythology we have come up with a game which is mostly based on the usage of intellectual skills.
